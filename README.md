This repository contains the supplementary codebase and data for the paper:

Jäger, Kiwit, and Riofrío, **Scaling Quantum Machine Learning without Tricks: High-Resolution and Diverse Image Generation**, 2026,

available as a preprint on the [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2603.00233).

The quantum generative adversarial network (QGAN) implementation is built upon
the [qugen](https://github.com/QutacQuantum/qugen) Python library. The baseline code was imported from commit `68fda95`. We thank the original authors for their open-source contributions.

# Organization of the repository

The repository is organized as follows:

- Training data sets must be stored and preprocessed in ''apps/logistics/training_data'' (scripts to preprocess raw data
  sets are included).
- Scripts to train and evaluate models are provided in ''run_scripts''.
- Any new experiment results are automatically stored in the ''apps/logistics/experiments'' folder.
- Model files of the trained QGANs are stored in the ''experiments'' folder.
- The corresponding QGAN training/experiment configuration files are provided in ''experiments_config'' (in CSV format).
  Each line corresponds to a single experiment/model.
- All figures and results presented in the paper are created in the Jupyter notebook ''plots_paper.ipynb''.
- The main implementation of the QGANs, based on the underlying qugen library, is found in ''qugen/main''.

# Installation

1) Create a virtual environment, e.g. using ``conda create --name qugen_env python=3.12.9``. Python 3.9 or later is
   supported.
2) Activate the environment, e.g ``conda activate qugen_env`` or ``source activate qugen_env``.
3) Run ``pip install .`` or ``pip install -e .`` to install it in editable mode.

### CUDA installation instructions

In order to run the models on CUDA GPUs, a CUDA supporting JAX built must be installed.
Typically, when installing the packages as instructed above, JAX is installed with CPU support only.
For CUDA support, perform the following steps (we recommend to create a new environment to switch between CPU and GPU
computing)

1) *(optional, recommended)* Create a new virtual environment (with a different name), activate it and install the
   requirements as specified in the three-step installation guide above.
2) Uninstall JAX via ``pip uninstall jax``
3) Determine CUDA driver version, e.g. using ``nvidia-smi``
4) Install JAX with the matching CUDA version, e.g. using ``pip install "jax[cuda12]==0.6.0"`` for CUDA driver version
    12. More information is provided in
        the [JAX installation guide](https://docs.jax.dev/en/latest/installation.html#pip-installation-nvidia-gpu-cuda-installed-via-pip-easier).

# Usage

## Training QGAN models

To train QGAN models, use the script ''run_scripts/run_experiments.py'' as follows:

```
cd apps/logistics
python ../../run_scripts/run_experiments.py --experiments_csv_path=[experiments_config.csv]
```

The argument ``experiments_csv_path`` specifies the path to the experiments configuration file (in CSV format) that
specifies the training settings for one or multiple experiments (one experiment per line).
Importantly, the first column specifies the result path and must be kept blank for experiments that are meant to be
trained.
When the training is completed successfully, this column is automatically updated to indicate the path where the model
and training results are stored.
All such configuration files used for the experiments presented in the paper are provided in the folder ''
experiments_configs''.
The training results are stored in a new model folder in ''apps/logistics/experiments'' indicated in the experiment
configuration file.
Note that the training datasets must be stored in ''apps/logistics/training_data'' and appropriately preprocessed (see
below).
(Multi-CPU/GPU training is supported and can be activated by the CLI flag ``n_processes``.)

## Evaluation of trained QGAN models

### Fréchet Inception Distance (FID)

To run the Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) evaluation of the trained models reported in the paper, run the Jupyter notebook ''FID_evaluation.ipynb''.
Please note that for some models, precomputed samples are used. These are created when running the Jupyter notebook ''plots_paper.ipynb'', which, hence, should be run before performing the FID evaluation. As the FIDs are evaluated with respect to the real datasets, these datasets have to be properly preprocessed and stored in ''apps/logistics/training_data'' (see section below on _Training dataset preparation_). The following datasets are used (classes for subsets are indicated in braces): MNIST, MNIST{0,1,2}, Fashion-MNIST, Fashion-MNIST{0,1}, SVHN{0}. Furthermore, to include the FID evaluation of the Patch-QGAN models (Tsang et al., 2023), please run the Jupyter notebook ''patchQGAN_benchmark.ipynb'' first to ensure that the samples are generated. 

### Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD)

To run the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) evaluation of trained models as used for the results presented in the paper,
use the script ''run_scripts/run_evaluations.py'' as follows:

```
cd apps/logistics
python ../../run_scripts/run_evaluations.py --experiments_csv_path=[experiments_config.csv] --eval_config_csv_path="../../experiments_configs/mmd_eval.csv" --n_iters_skip=[N] --n_samples=[M]
```

The argument ``experiments_csv_path`` specifies the path to the experiments configuration file (in CSV format) that was
used to train the models, such as for the trained models in ``experiments_configs``.
Further, specify the number N of iterations to skip between evaluating a checkpointed model (e.g. N=499 iterations used
for the paper results) via ``n_iters_skip``. Note that by default checkpoints are only created every 100 iterations, N
should be chosen as a multiple of 100 minus 1 to hit the checkpoints.
Provide the number M of samples to generate from the trained model to
evaluate the MMD metrics (M=5000 in the paper) via ``n_samples``.
The evaluation results are stored in the model folder indicated in the experiment configuration file and named ''
evaluation_summary.csv''.

## Plots

The Jupyter notebook ''plots_paper.ipynb'' creates all plots and figures presented in the paper.
For example, it loads images stored during training or generates new images from trained models (based on parameter
checkpoints), which may take a while.
The final plots are automatically stored in the folder ''plots_paper''.

## Training dataset preparation

Training datasets must be stored in the ''apps/logistics/training_data'' folder in numpy format (``.npy`` files).
Scripts to preprocess raw datasets are provided in the same folder, i.e., ''mnist_preprocessing.py'', ''
fashion_mnist_preprocessing.py'', and ''svhn_preprocessing.py''.
Each of these scripts specifies in comments where to download the raw dataset and how to name the files when placing
them in the ''apps/logistics/training_data'' folder. For convenience, these instructions are repeated below.
Importantly, the QGAN implementation expects image resolutions of powers of two, e.g. 32x32, which must be specified
when running the preprocessing scripts.
Furthermore, to create a training dataset with only a subset of classes, the desired classes can be specified as a
comma-separated list of integers.
As an example, to preprocess the MNIST dataset to 32x32 resolution for the digits 0 to 2, run

```
cd apps/logistics/training_data
python mnist_processing.py --img_size=32 --digit="[0,1,2]"
```

The following raw datasets are required to be downloaded manually and placed in the ''apps/logistics/training_data''
folder before running the respective preprocessing scripts:

- MNIST:  Download raw data (''train_images.npy'' and ''
  train_labels.npy'') [here](https://github.com/sebastian-lapuschkin/lrp_toolbox/tree/master/data/MNIST) and save files
  as ''mnist_raw.npy'' and ''mnist_labels_raw.npy'', respectively.
- Fashion-MNIST: Download raw data (''train-images-idx3-ubyte.gz'' and ''
  train-labels-idx1-ubyte.gz'') [here](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist?tab=readme-ov-file) and save
  files as ''fashion_mnist_train_raw.gz'' and ''fashion_mnist_train_labels_raw.gz'', respectively.
- SVHN: Download raw data (''extra_32x32.mat'') [here](http://ufldl.stanford.edu/housenumbers/) and save the file as ''
  svhn_extra_32x32.mat''.

# Miscellaneous

#### Config files

A convenient way to specify multiple trainings is offered by creating config files in the CSV format and should be
stored in ''apps/logistics/experiments''.
Each row specifies a single experiment setting, while each column is linked to a ``main`` function argument in ''
apps/logistics/train_image_qgan.py'' (default values are used if not specified) and therefore has to match these
argument names. Alternatively, when using the CLI of ''apps/logistics/run_experiments.py'', provide this config file
path via the parameter ``--experiments_csv_path={}``
However, the following exceptions exist:

- *result_path*: This column/value is automatically organized by ''apps/logistics/run_experiments.py'' and can be in
  five different states

  | Value                      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
  |----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
  | *(Empty)*                  | This experiment has not been run. In order to run this experiment the next time when the config file is passed to ''apps/logistics/run_experiments.py'', this cell should left empty. (note that in CSV this is realized by directly providing the next comma without any whitespace.) |
  | *...*                      | This experiment is currently queued for training by a ''apps/logistics/run_experiments.py'' run.                                                                                                                                                                                       |
  | *...(p{id})*               | This experiment is currently trained and executed by the process with ID *id*.                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
  | *...ERR:{msg}*             | The training of this experiment raised an error with message *msg* and is ended.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
  | *experiments/{model_name}* | The experiment has been completed successfully and the results can be found under the specified path.                                                                                                                                                                                  |

- *data_set_{}*: The argument ``data_set_name`` must either correspond to a numpy training data set file in ''
  apps/logistics/training_data'' or it can be a Python f-string, i.e., contains unspecified keywords indicated by curly
  braces. In the latter case, all other arguments/columns starting with *data_set_* are aggregated as data set keyword
  arguments and used to construct the final ``data_set_name`` by replacing the keywords accordingly.
  For example, ``data_set_name = mnist{data_set_class}{data_set_img_size}x{data_set_img_size}_N_{data_set_n_samples}``
  with values *_0_1_2_3_4_5_6_7_8_9_*, *32*, and *60000* for the keywords *data_set_class*, *data_set_img_size*, and
  *data_set_n_samples*, respectively, is turned into ``data_set_name = mnist_0_1_2_3_4_5_6_7_8_9_32x32_N_60000``.

An example for a configuration CSV file specifying three experiments (one completed, one in progress, one unscheduled)

#### Parallel execution of experiments in config file

For parallel execution of *N* experiments provided in a config file, increase the argument ``n_processes`` to *N* in the
``main`` function in ''apps/logistics/run_experiments.py'' (or pass the parameter ``--n_processes=N`` via the CLI of ''
apps/logistics/run_experiments.py'').
When run in GPU mode, this will reserve a single GPU per experiment. The least busy GPUs (by memory utilization) are
automatically determined and the top-level list variable ``EXCLUDE_GPUS`` in ''apps/logistics/run_experiments.py'' can
be used to exclude certain GPUs by their ID from the training. 

#### Patch-QGAN benchmarking

To run the benchmark with the Patch-QGAN framework (Tsang et al., 2023), which reproduces the models and generates samples, please refer to the Jupyter notebook ''patchQGAN_benchmark.ipynb''. This is based on the original implementation provided on [GitHub](https://github.com/jasontslxd/PQWGAN). This repository is automatically cloned when running the notebook. The model checkpoint files for the trained models reproduced for the present work are provided in ''experiments/patch_qgan_models''.
